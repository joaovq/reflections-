How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was really simple because running this command on linux it showed the lines which were removed and added 
so I could clearly see what was the difference 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Well, if you can have acess to the entire history you can see everything that happened during the development 
process so it is kind of easy to take a look and find eventually bugs 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Well, I think it's better a manual commit because as long as you are working in the project you better know what time is a commit time. 
Imagine if you're working on a new feature and it's not finished yet so the version control automatically commits it and later you change it 
It can go into a loop like this which will always save and you change, save again and so on
